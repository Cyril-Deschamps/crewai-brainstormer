# Autonomous Initialization – Generate a Unique Persona with a Problem Statement
initialization_proposition_A:
  description: >
    Generate a fully randomized fictitious persona to serve as a starting point for our design thinking session.
    The persona should be realistic, diverse, and representative of various life experiences while avoiding extreme edge cases or clichés.

    Include the following attributes:
      - "name": A randomly generated name.
      - "age_range": A plausible age range (e.g., "25-30", "40-45").
      - "lifestyle": A brief description of their everyday context (e.g., busy parent, urban dweller, digital native, etc.).
      - "behavior": A brief but insightful description of their personality, habits, or lifestyle in everyday contexts.
      - "pain_points": A list (3-5) of specific, concrete frustrations, obstacles, or challenges they regularly encounter in their daily life (avoid focusing solely on work-related issues).
      - "problem_statement": A one-sentence description (max 10-15 words) of a significant challenge this persona faces.
        The issue should be meaningful, relatable, and not overly generic or mainstream (avoid problem concerning fitness and food and time management). A good example can be : "Find a friend and challenge yourself to move forward faster with daily tasks and work to stop procrastinating." or also "Choose my outfits more easily and have an instant opinion."
        Assume that this is a problem that the persona has already tried to solve using a mobile application, but it didn't work.

    Guidelines:
      - Avoid generating stereotypical or overly niche profiles—aim for a broad variety of personas.
      - Ensure diversity in age, lifestyle, and everyday challenges.
      - The problem statement should be clear, compelling, and grounded in real-world struggles.
      - Introduce variability in responses to prevent repeated patterns.
      
    # Adding contextual dynamics
    Situational Context:
      - Consider a specific time context (morning rush, evening leisure, weekend activity)
      - Add environmental factors that might influence this persona's behavior
      - Include social dynamics that affect how they interact with potential solutions

# Added Multi-Turn Interaction - Challenge the initial persona
initialization_challenge:
  description: >
    Review the persona created in the previous task and identify potential assumptions, biases, or gaps in the profile that might limit our understanding.

    Consider:
    - Are there unstated needs beneath the surface problem?
    - What assumptions might we be making about this persona?
    - Are there contradictions or inconsistencies in the profile that need clarification?
    - How might different contexts (cultural, economic, technological) affect this persona's relationship with the problem?

    Challenge at least three aspects of the initial persona in a constructive way. Your goal is not to dismiss the work, but to enrich and deepen our understanding by questioning initial assumptions.

# Persona Refinement - Incorporating feedback
initialization_refinement:
  description: >
    Based on the initial persona profile and the challenges raised, create a refined, more nuanced persona that addresses the identified gaps and assumptions.

    In your refinement:
    - Address each challenge in a thoughtful way
    - Deepen the persona's complexity without losing clarity
    - Deliberately include a minor contradiction or tension in the persona's needs (to make them more realistic)
    - Add specific contextual details that would impact how they interact with potential solutions
  expected_output: >

# Empathy Map – Gather User Insights
empathy_map_collect_A:
  description: >
    Based on the given persona and its simplified problem_statement, simulate a brief but insightful user interview.
    Capture at least five key statements reflecting what the persona **says, thinks, feels, and does** when experiencing the problem.

    **Encourage responses that include specific, measurable details and real-life examples, avoiding generic or overly idealized statements. The tone should remain authentic and fact-based.**

    # Adding variability in tone and detail
    Your interview should:
    - Include one answer where the persona is clearly frustrated and emotional
    - Include one answer where the persona initially misunderstands your question (showing realistic miscommunication)
    - Include one answer that reveals an unexpected insight or seemingly contradictory need
    - Vary the level of detail between responses (some detailed, some more vague)

    # Add situational context dynamics
    - Set the interview in a specific environment (coffee shop, home office, public transport)
    - Reference a recent event or circumstance that has made their problem more acute
    - Introduce an external factor that occasionally affects their interaction with the problem

# Added Cross-Verification Task
empathy_map_verification:
  description: >
    Critically review the empathy map interview data collected. As a data analyst, your role is to verify the internal consistency of the findings and highlight any potential biases or misleading patterns in the data.

    In your assessment:
    - Identify any statements that seem inconsistent with the persona profile
    - Point out where interviewer bias might have influenced the responses
    - Highlight any areas where more data would be valuable
    - Note if cultural or contextual factors might be affecting the interpretation of responses
    - Suggest at least one specific follow-up question to clarify ambiguous responses

    Remember to maintain a balanced perspective - your goal is to strengthen the research, not dismiss it.

# Add Error Correction and Iteration
empathy_map_collect_B:
  description: >
    Based on the persona profile and the data validation feedback, conduct a follow-up observation session to address the identified gaps and inconsistencies. This time, focus on **observing** the persona in their natural environment rather than interviewing them.

    In your observation:
    - Focus specifically on the areas identified as inconsistent or requiring more data
    - Document any behaviors that contradict what the persona "said" versus what they actually "do"
    - Note environmental or contextual factors that weren't previously considered
    - Include at least one unexpected behavior that provides new insight

    # Introduce a situational variable
    During your observation, an unexpected event occurs (choose something contextually appropriate) that reveals how the persona handles disruption or changes to their routine.

  agent: researcher

empathy_map_comparison:
  description: >
    Analyze and compare the insights gathered from the interview and the observations.
    Identify recurring themes, patterns, and notable contradictions.

    Structure the comparison as follows:
      - "common_insights": A list of key themes, behaviors, or concrete pain points that appear in both the interview and observations.
      - "differences": A list of insights where the interview and observations diverge, highlighting discrepancies or missing details.
      
    **Ensure that the analysis is factual and specific, avoiding hyperbolic language.**

    Guidelines:
      - Focus on patterns related to emotions, motivations, needs, and challenges.
      - Ensure insights are well-structured and avoid overly generic points.
      - When applicable, explain why certain differences might exist (e.g., context, bias, external factors).

  agent: design_facilitator

empathy_map_synthesis:
  description: >
    Generate a synthesized Empathy Map by consolidating insights from multiple sources into a single, coherent view.
    The Empathy Map should reflect the persona's perspective across four dimensions:
      - "say": Direct or paraphrased statements the persona verbalizes.
      - "think": Internal thoughts, concerns, or beliefs, including those not openly expressed.
      - "feel": Emotional responses, underlying motivations, and frustrations.
      - "do": Observable actions, behaviors, or habits in daily life.
      
    **Ensure that the synthesis includes specific, authentic details that can inform the design of a pragmatic, single-purpose mobile app.
    Avoid overly idealized or vague language.**

    Each key must map to an array containing at least three distinct and concise insights.
    Ensure the synthesis maintains clarity and avoids redundancy.

# As-Is Scenario Map – Document the Current State
asis_scenario_map_proposition_A:
  description: >
    Based on the persona's problem_statement and empathy insights, generate a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the actions the persona currently takes to solve their problem.
    Each step should clearly describe what the persona does and include at least one specific pain point, with measurable details when possible. 

    **Emphasize areas where a simple, viral mobile solution focused on one key functionality could streamline these steps and reduce user frustration.
    Avoid suggesting multi-functional, all-in-one solutions. Also, reference realistic constraints or trade-offs.**

    Guidelines:
      - Maintain logical sequencing of steps from the persona's perspective.
      - Avoid assumptions beyond the provided insights.
      - Ensure each step is actionable and specific.
      - Each step must include at least one corresponding pain point that explains why the current approach is inefficient or frustrating.

    **Focus on identifying friction points that a simple, single-purpose mobile app could resolve, and mention realistic user constraints that a solution should consider.
    Avoid suggestions that require bundling unrelated functionalities.**

    Guidelines:
    - Clearly outline each step in the revised workflow.

    The final map should integrate the strengths of each proposal while addressing identified weaknesses and assumptions.

    # Added error correction element
    In your synthesis:
    - Acknowledge the key assumptions identified in the comparison
    - Propose specific adjustments to address each assumption
    - Include at least one alternative flow for when the primary process encounters issues
    - Identify 2-3 potential edge cases and how the solution would handle them

    # Added contextual variability
    Your synthesis should also address:
    - How the solution adapts to different user contexts (time, place, emotional state)
    - How the solution handles unexpected changes in user circumstances
    - Where the solution might need to be flexible vs. where it should be consistent

# Writing Hills – Refine the Mobile App Solution Narrative
writing_hills_proposition_A:
  description: >
    Using the final synthesized solution narrative, create a concise "Who-What-Wow" statement that articulates the core value proposition of your mobile application solution.

    # Added contextual dimension
    Your statement should:
    - Clearly identify a specific user profile (WHO)
    - Articulate a concrete, measurable outcome (WHAT)
    - Express a distinctive, emotionally resonant benefit that sets the solution apart (WOW)

    # Added realistic limitation acknowledgment
    In addition to the core statement, include:
    - One practical limitation or boundary condition of the solution
    - How this limitation is actually turned into a strength (focus, simplicity, etc.)
    - A time-based element showing how value evolves with continued use
